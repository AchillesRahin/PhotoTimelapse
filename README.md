# PhotoTimelapse
 
current features: 
-take picture
-flip camera
-retakepicture/save photo

"gallery" - currently gallery is available to see, but 
it's just a view for testing definitely will be updated.

Still deciding on how to do the time lapse whether it will just
be a group of photos in folders together by timestamp or like ability to 
save as a video.

One use case is gym pictures to count progress

testing the app as a dev: (I haven't done this from a clone so this might need to be updated)

prereqs- need to install npm 

once you clone the app run "npm install" from within the app directory, this should hypothetically install all dependencies

then on your iphone or android get the app called "expo" it's a developer app that let's you run react native apps from your computer to phone

run the following
'npm start'

this should open a new window with a QR code which you can use the camera app in your phone point it at the qr and it should 
give the option to open up expo. 
Once you open up expo the app should start can let me know if there are issues.
